## Problem
  1. Cognitive Overload: Students often face challenges with information overload in traditional learning, impacting processing and retention.
  2. Limited Interactivity: Current educational methods lack engagement, affecting students' absorption of material.
  3. Insufficient Practice Opportunities: Without regular, targeted practice, students may struggle to internalize knowledge, hindering deeper understanding.
## Idea
>We propose the development of a chatbot, QAGenerate AzureOpenAI, designed to generate questions based on content to support student learning.

>Our primary focus is to empower students with an engaging and relevant learning tool. The chatbot will analyze documents submitted by students and generate context-specific, fitting questions. This approach aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the document's content.

  1. Engagement: The interactive nature of the chatbot promotes active participation and sustained interest in the learning process.

  2. Document Analysis: Thorough analysis of provided documents ensures relevance in question generation.

  3. Relevance: Context-specific questions ensure that students focus on essential aspects, promoting effective learning.

## Technical Solution
### _Technologies Used_
  1. Azure OpenAI: Utilized for interacting with AI models. It harnesses powerful natural language processing capabilities to comprehend and analyze textual content, enabling the generation of relevant questions.

  2. Dotenv (python-dotenv): This library manages environment variables to enhance security and flexibility, safely storing API keys and other sensitive information required for interacting with external services.

  3. OpenAI Python Package: Employed to seamlessly communicate with the Azure OpenAI API, enhancing the precision and relevance of the questions generated.

  4. Streamlit: The library for building user interfaces for applications. Streamlit provides an intuitive and responsive interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot, receive generated questions, and track their learning progress.
